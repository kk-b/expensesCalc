# expensesCalc

Using regular expressions I just learned from class, I was able to parse through my already expenses document to calculate the total number of dollars I spent within each month. A future update to this python file allowed me to categorize each entry to see how much I spent in each category in addition to the total amount I spent per month/year. After running the script, it outputs the results in the terminal and it also creates a file with the results.
